"""
Here I implemented the REST API using FastAPI framework.
The API exposes endpoints to interact with the AQUA_SENSE system, allowing users to retrieve sensor data,
manage devices, and configure system settings.

Get for devices, telemetry, rules and alerts. Swagger docs is obrigatory. 

This API represents a northbound interface for external systems to interact with AQUA_SENSE.
